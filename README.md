## Welcome
My name is Michelle Shelton, but you can call me MJ. I'm a passionate and dedicated developer who recently finished the Northwesten Coding Bootcamp for Full Stack Web Development. In my previous career as a Project Manager (PMP) in television production, I have 10 years of experience leading teams on multi-million dollar projects with such household names as Netflix, Apple, and Disney. During that time, I frequently found myself in charge of IT management which became a passion that I know get to call my every day as I work hard to grow my skills.
