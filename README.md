## Welcome
My name is Michelle Shelton, but you can call me MJ. I'm a passionate and dedicated developer who recently finished the Northwesten Coding Bootcamp for Fullstack Web Development. In my previous career in television production, I have 10 years of experience leading teams on multi-million dollar projects with such household names as Netflix, Apple, and Disney. During that time, I frequently found myself in charge of IT management which became a passion that I know get to call my every day as I work hard to grow my skills.

Please reach out if you're looking for a loyal, eager, and hard-working developer to join your team.

## About Me
I'm a fullstack coder most interested in backend development. I'm based in the Chicagoland area.

I have two dogs who help me code by curling up in my lap or by my feet as I spend hours staring at a screen. It helps a lot.

## Technical Skills:

Languages: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS

Backend: Node.js, MySQL, Express, MongoDB

Frontend: ReactJS, Handlebars.js, JQuery, Bootstrap
