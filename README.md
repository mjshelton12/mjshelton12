## Welcome

## About Me
My career started as a Project Manager (PMP) in television where I have 10 years of experience leading teams on multi-million dollar projects with such household names as Netflix, Apple, and Disney. Through my time, I frequently found myself in charge of IT management and eventually realized I enjoyed the technical work I was doing more than the production work. So I decided to turn my passion into a fulltime career. Today, I use the communication, grit, and big-picture thinking skills I developed through my career along with my technical skills to produce high quality, efficent, and effective code. Currently, I work as a Teacher's Assitant at Northwestern's Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp.
